They have the freedom to express themselves and can take unexpected turns. Therefore, when designing a conversational experience, you must be prepared for non-linear user interactions.</p><p>While it is possible to map out every linear path that user might follow, doing so will the prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. On the other hand, the number of services that you want to expose conversationally are limited. Instead, you need to consider the core of your business, the experience you want to bring to users, and how users can get services through interaction. The key is to think about the specific goals of your conversation and to design it accordingly.</p><h2 id="gathering-requirements" tabindex="-1">Gathering requirements <a class="header-anchor" href="#gathering-requirements" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Gathering requirements&quot;">​</a></h2><p>First, identify the core of your business. What are the essential services that you offer? What kind of information do your users need to provide? What are the key features that you want to highlight?

This involves considering how users will interact with your CUI to get the services they need. Do they prefer to be informed, get recommendations, have things confirmed, or have things clarified? You might want to focus on providing users with a way to quickly and easily get the information they need and encouraging them to take action.

This is because it can be difficult to identify problems when you are immersed in the design process. An outsider&#39;s opinion can be helpful in identifying problems that you may not have noticed. The good news is that you can get insight into whether your design will work for users before writing a single line of code.</p><h2 id="design-for-the-long-tail" tabindex="-1">Design for the long tail <a class="header-anchor" href="#design-for-the-long-tail" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Design for the long tail&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In the last phase of the process, you will specify the detailed design for your conversational feature.
