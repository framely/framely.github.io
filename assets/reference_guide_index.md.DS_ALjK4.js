It assumes that your services are already developed and deployed. Once you declare your services on the <a href="https://build.opencui.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">platform</a>, you can use a declarative approach to build the conversational interface for them.</p><p>To make the most of OpenCUI, it&#39;s important to understand its type-based conceptual model, which is different from the more common flow-based approach. We have created a series of tutorials that will guide you through the process of understanding the conceptual model and becoming skilled at using OpenCUI to create excellent conversational experiences.</p><h4 id="sign-up" tabindex="-1"><a href="./signingup.html">Sign up</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#sign-up" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Sign up](signingup)&quot;">​</a></h4><p>We&#39;re still in beta, so we need you to sign up before you can use our service. This will help us allocate resources and make sure you have the best possible experience. All you need is a GitHub account, and it&#39;s best if your email is verified.</p><h4 id="clone-an-echo-chatbot" tabindex="-1"><a href="./clone-simple-chatbot.html">Clone an echo chatbot</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#clone-an-echo-chatbot" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Clone an echo chatbot](clone-simple-chatbot)&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Here&#39;s a quick way to get started: clone an existing project.
