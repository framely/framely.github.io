After completing this tutorial, you will be able to develop a level 2 conversational experience, which is sufficient for allowing users to check your business hours or make a reservation. But let&#39;s start with a bit of background, as you will be using a new and more effective approach to build the chatbot.</p><h2 id="background" tabindex="-1">Background <a class="header-anchor" href="#background" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Background&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A chatbot is an application with a conversational user interface (CUI). It is developed to provide user services, including answering informational questions and completing transactional tasks. A service is an interface for a business capability that usually consists of a set of Application Programming Interface (API) functions. These interfaces decouple the front end, like the chatbot, from the backend implementation of the service, so that they can be developed independently.</p><p>In order to invoke API functions in a conversational manner, the chatbot needs to create an instance of a function type through conversations, which implies that chatbot also needs to create instances for the input parameters of the function or attributes of composite types in a more general sense.</p><p>A type is considered conversationally exposed if the chatbot knows how to create an instance of it conversationally, potentially in multiple turns. This suggests a different approach to building chatbots: identify the API function types that you want to expose to users, and make these types, as well as all of their dependent types (both direct and indirect), conversationally exposed.</p><p>A type-based chatbot with multiple language support can then function in the following way:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Convert the user&#39;s utterance into an event</strong>. Here, an event is a way of representing the meaning of a user&#39;s utterance in a language-independent way.</p></li><li><p><strong>Given the event and the current dialog state, generate a dialog act</strong>. A dialog act is also a language-independent representation of meaning. It is generated by following interaction logic that greedily tries to complete the instantiation of the function type. Once a function object is created, the chatbot can invoke it and wrap the function return in a dialog act.</p></li><li><p><strong>Render the dialog act back to the user in natural language</strong>.</p></li></ol><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">The same concept is also illustrated here:</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="type-based cui"></p></div><h3 id="a-proper-type-system" tabindex="-1">A proper type system <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-proper-type-system" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;A proper type system&quot;">​</a></h3><p>OpenCUI is designed to support most APIs that can be defined by OpenAPI, which is a widely used standard for documenting RESTful APIs. This means that you can conversationally expose not only to primitive types like Int and String, but also to arrays and user-defined types with polymorphism support. This makes it easy to build conversational interfaces for arbitrary service APIs. In OpenCUI, functions are represented by skills, user-defined types are represented by frames, and primitive types are represented by entities.</p><p>Types declared in OpenCUI can be either internal or external. For internal types, OpenCUI generates a Kotlin class, while for external types, it uses existing Java/Kotlin types, ensuring that every type has a direct representation at the Java/Kotlin level. This allows users to tap into the vast Java ecosystem and leverage any available functionality, as well as use Kotlin code expressions to directly express logic.</p><h3 id="build-chatbot-in-3-layers" tabindex="-1">Build chatbot in 3 layers <a class="header-anchor" href="#build-chatbot-in-3-layers" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Build chatbot in 3 layers&quot;">​</a></h3><p>OpenCUI promotes a type-based approach to build conversational user interface, by introducing a set of dialog annotations that you can add to the type and its slots. For each composite type that you need to expose conversationally:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Declare the type at the schema layer</strong>. This includes the label of the type, the slots that are associated with the type, and the local functions and services that are available to the type.</p></li><li><p><strong>Add dialog annotations, and configure them in the interaction layer</strong>. The interaction layer determines the language-independent aspects of the conversational interactions: whether the chatbot should ask the user to fill a slot, whether to provide a candidate list, and whether to confirm with the user when a value is received.</p></li><li><p><strong>For each language you want to support, configure annotations in required language layer</strong>. The annotations in the language layer help dialog understanding module to map the text in the target language to structured semantics and back. For example, if you are creating a chatbot that supports English and Chinese, you will need to configure language layer annotations for both languages.</p></li></ol><p>The primitive types, or entities, can be defined in only two layers: schema and language.</p><p>Clearly, a chatbot always consists of many types, and the order in which these types are defined matters. It is important to ensure that all the required types are defined before they are referenced, in order to avoid any circular dependencies or reference errors.</p><h4 id="annotate-a-composite-type" tabindex="-1">Annotate a composite type <a class="header-anchor" href="#annotate-a-composite-type" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Annotate a composite type&quot;">​</a></h4><p>It is common for composite types to have slots, and then you have to decide whether you want to follow a layer-first or slot-first approach to annotate such types. In this series of quickstart guides, annotation will be added in a slot-first, or one-slot-at-a-time approach, making it easy for you to follow:</p><ol><li>Repeat the following steps for each slot: <ol><li>Add all annotations needed for that slot, and configure them in the interaction layer.</li><li>Configure annotations in the language layer.</li></ol></li><li>Add the type level annotation, in both layers.</li><li>If the type is a skill, configure the response for it, in both layers.</li></ol><h2 id="before-you-start" tabindex="-1">Before you start <a class="header-anchor" href="#before-you-start" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Before you start&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li>Log in to <a href="https://build.opencui.io/login" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">OpenCUI</a>.</li><li><a href="./clone-simple-chatbot.html">Clone a simple chatbot</a> to get an idea of what to build.</li></ul><h2 id="create-chatbot-pingpong" tabindex="-1">Create chatbot: pingpong <a class="header-anchor" href="#create-chatbot-pingpong" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Create chatbot: pingpong&quot;">​</a></h2><p>You can create a chatbot under any organization, following these steps:</p><ol><li><p>Within an organization, in the upper right corner of the project area, click <strong>Create</strong> and select <strong>Create chatbot</strong>.</p></li><li><p>In the pop-up window, complete the form for chatbot basic settings and click <strong>Create</strong>. For this simple chatbot, you only need to fill in the following three fields:</p><ul><li><strong>Project label</strong>: The unique identifier for the chatbot. Type a short, memorable label for your chatbot. We suggest using a lowercase label. For example, <code>pingpong</code>.</li><li><strong>Region</strong>: Where you want to deploy this chatbot. Ideally, it should be close to your users.</li><li><strong>Languages</strong>: The language your chatbot supports. In this case, select <strong>English(en)</strong>.</li></ul></li></ol><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Caution: Project label and region are immutable.</p><p>Choose your project label and region carefully, because you cannot change them after creation.

The conversational experience you will create in this guide requires a dependent entity type called <code>Location</code> and a skill called <code>PingPong</code>.</p><h3 id="build-entity-location" tabindex="-1">Build entity: Location <a class="header-anchor" href="#build-entity-location" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Build entity: Location&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The most basic type in OpenCUI is &quot;entity&quot;. It is a primitive type that the chatbot knows how to extract the value of from the user&#39;s utterance. OpenCUI provides many predefined entities, such as <code>java.time.LocalDate</code> for dates, <code>io.opencui.core.Email</code> for email addresses, and so on. You cannot change these predefined entities. OpenCUI also allows you to create custom entities. A custom entity instance contains a single reference label in schema layer and a list of expressions based on the user mentions in their utterance in language layer. To help the chatbot better understand the user, it is helpful to enumerate common expressions for each instance.</p><p>In this case, let&#39;s build a custom entity type <code>Location</code> in schema layer and language layer as follows.</p><h4 id="create-entity-location" tabindex="-1">Create entity: Location <a class="header-anchor" href="#create-entity-location" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Create entity: Location&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Inside the <code>pingpong</code> chatbot and <strong>Types</strong> page:</p><ol><li>Click <strong>Create</strong> button on the right side, and select <strong>Create entity</strong> to create a new entity.</li><li>Enter a label for the entity type and press enter.

Names are language-dependent representations of the entity type, and they will be used for both detecting mentions of this type from the user&#39;s utterance and displaying the use of this type to the user. Note this need to be done for every type.</p><p>Inside the <code>Location</code> entity and <strong>Expression</strong> tab, in the <strong>Names</strong> section, enter <code>location</code> for the Location entity and press enter.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="PingPong add entity expression"></p><h3 id="build-skill-pingpong" tabindex="-1">Build skill: PingPong <a class="header-anchor" href="#build-skill-pingpong" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Build skill: PingPong&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Conceptually, a skill is a function exposed in a conversational manner, with input parameters represented by its slots. In this tutorial, you will construct a basic skill called <code>PingPong</code> that has a single slot of type <code>Location</code>. Once an instance of this function type is created, the chatbot will respond with an acknowledgment in the form of <code>pong to ${location}</code>.</p><h4 id="schema-layer-declare-a-skill" tabindex="-1">Schema layer: declare a skill <a class="header-anchor" href="#schema-layer-declare-a-skill" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Schema layer: declare a skill&quot;">​</a></h4><p>At this layer, you will create the skill and add all its slots that represent input parameters for the corresponding function.
