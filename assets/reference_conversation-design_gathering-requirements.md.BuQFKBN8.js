At its core, it is about understanding the business, the users, and the technical capabilities. By starting with clear and well-researched requirements, you can avoid major changes later in the development process.</p><h2 id="identify-your-business" tabindex="-1">Identify your business <a class="header-anchor" href="#identify-your-business" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Identify your business&quot;">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>Ensure all the necessary information will be collected in a logical and efficient manner.</p></blockquote><p>When designing conversational user experiences (CUIs), it is important to focus on the service that will provide. This is because the service determines the tasks that the CUI can perform and how it will interact with users.</p><p>To start, you need to answer the following questions:</p><ul><li>What are the essential services that you offer?</li><li>What kind of information do your users need to provide?</li><li>What are the key features that you want to highlight?</li></ul><h3 id="create-a-schema" tabindex="-1">Create a schema <a class="header-anchor" href="#create-a-schema" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Create a schema&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Once you have a good understanding of the service, you can create a schema that outlines all the required slots and their types. The schema will determine the information that needs to be collected from customers, and it will help to ensure that chatbot conversations are efficient and structured.</p><p>For example, if you are a restaurant owner, you want to provide a reservation service to your customers. A restaurant reservation chatbot needs to know at least the following information to complete a reservation:</p><ul><li>The number of guests</li><li>The date and time</li><li>The contact person and information</li><li>Any special requests or dietary restrictions</li></ul><p>Once this information is collected, the chatbot can determine the best way to interact with the user. For example, if the user does not provide all of the necessary information, the chatbot can prompt them for the missing information. If the time reserved by the user is not available, the chatbot can offer alternative times or suggest other restaurants.</p><p>However, if this information is not confirmed in advance, it will be difficult to start the conversation design with the user&#39;s expressions. This is because there are endless ways that users can express themselves, and if they do not provide the necessary information, it will be impossible to complete the booking. More rounds of dialogue will only make the chatbot inefficient.</p><h3 id="example" tabindex="-1">Example <a class="header-anchor" href="#example" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Example&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Here is an example of a schema that you could use for a restaurant reservation chatbot:</p><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:left;">Slots</th><th style="text-align:left;">Type</th><th style="text-align:left;">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:left;">Number of guests</td><td style="text-align:left;">Int</td><td style="text-align:left;"><em>Required</em>.

The chatbot can also help to reduce the number of phone calls and emails that you receive, freeing up your time to focus on other tasks.</p><h2 id="identify-your-users" tabindex="-1">Identify your users <a class="header-anchor" href="#identify-your-users" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Identify your users&quot;">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>Get a better understanding of your users&#39; needs and expectations.</p></blockquote><p>While it is important to optimize your product for your most frequent users, you should not do so at the expense of other users&#39; experiences. A well-designed product is inclusive and universally accessible. This means designing for different populations, such as people with disabilities, people who speak different languages, and people with different levels of technical expertise.</p><p>Here are some tips for accommodating all users:</p><ul><li><strong>Consider different abilities and disabilities.</strong> When designing your chatbot, think about how people with different abilities and disabilities will interact with it. For example, you may need to provide alternative ways for users to interact with your chatbot if they are blind or have limited mobility.</li><li><strong>Use clear and concise language.</strong> Your chatbot&#39;s language should be clear and concise, so that users of all levels of understanding can easily understand it. Avoid using jargon or technical terms that users may not be familiar with.</li><li><strong>Provide multiple ways to get help.</strong> If users get stuck or have questions, they should be able to get help easily. You can provide multiple ways for users to get help, such as live chat.</li><li><strong>Test your chatbot with a variety of users.</strong> Once you have designed your chatbot, it is important to test it with a variety of users to make sure that it is accessible and usable for everyone.</li></ul><h3 id="create-user-personas-and-journeys" tabindex="-1">Create user personas and journeys <a class="header-anchor" href="#create-user-personas-and-journeys" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Create user personas and journeys&quot;">​</a></h3><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:left;">User persona</th><th style="text-align:left;">User journeys</th><th style="text-align:left;">Critical user journeys</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:left;">Who is the user?</td><td style="text-align:left;">What are the user’s goals?
